In the current consumer computers, every program runs for a specific time slot, and then it stops its execution to let another program continue its execution. This thing runs in a cycle so fast thatâ€™s impossible to notice, and we think our computers run many programs simultaneously, but this is an illusion (except on multiprocessor machines).
-Normally, programming languages are synchronous, and some provide a way to manage asynchronicity, in the language or through libraries. C, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Ruby, Swift, Python, they are all synchronous by default. Some of them handle async by using threads, spawning a new process.
-JavaScript is synchronous by default and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new threads and run in parallel.
