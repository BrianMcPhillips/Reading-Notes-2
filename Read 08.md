SQL stands for structured query language. 
A database is nothing but a collection of organized data. It doesnâ€™t have to be in a digital format to be called a database.
Most database systems differ in the way they provide database creation facilities. Ingres achieves the same by providing you multiple ways to do this, including through the Visual DBA utility. However for didactic purposes, we will instead use a command operation to create our database.
A constraint is a rule that you apply or abide by while doing SQL operations.
To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.
