When you are problem solving you are doing one of two things. Either you are fixing something that is broken, or you are building something. If you are building something, it could be a completely new something, or it could be an improved something. Be open minded, the actual problem you have may be different to the problem you think you have. What you think is causing the problem may not actually be what is causing the problem. The best option may be to throw out your solution and start again in a different direction. Your beliefs on anything and everything could be wrong.
Be inquisitive, things that seem odd or stand out, any patterns, anything that is there that maybe shouldn't be, anything that is missing.
Ask the right questions, what is it actually doing, how is it actually doing it, how effectively is it performing its purpose, why is it doing it what would happen if it was taken out, what is it's relationship with other components, what could I do to test that assumption. Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
