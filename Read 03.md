Responsive Web Design
    -Mobile internet usage is set to pass desktop internet usage in the near future. This has created a need for web design that is suitable for all users also known as RWD.
    -Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.
    -Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. 
    -Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.
    -Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches. 
    -Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.
    -Floats are useful CSS positioning properties. Floats can be used to create enture web layouts. One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them
    -Most websites are displayed in Grid. If a more complex layout presents itself, people often reach for a grid framework. The hardest part about grid is gutters.
