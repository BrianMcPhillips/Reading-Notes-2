Applying Atomic Design
    -Start big and work your way down, start off by marking the big elements into organisms, then further design those organisms into molecules. Molecules are sections that can be easily extracted from an Organism. Next extract atoms from the molecules, atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels inputes buttons and others that can't be broken down any further. 
    -The folder structure makes it easier to find and identify the different types of components, it is more advisable to separate components into different folders for organisms molecules and atoms.
    -When designing it is good to start big and work your way down, it is the opposite when coding these elements, start small and work your way up.
    -componenets need to be as small and reusable as possible.
    -React manifested component driven approaches to UI development, not just as good practice but as something you cannot go past anymore. Components have become the miracle solution to the front-end complexity problems from five years ago. Instead of designing pages design systems of components
    -developers waste time by re implementing patterns they already have 
    -React is the premier way to build big fast web apps with javascript. It has scaled very well for facebook and instagram.
    -Step 1 break the UI into a component hierarchy, draw boxes of every component in the mock and give them all names
