    -URLSearchParams interfaces define utility methods to work with the query string of a URL. An object implementing URLSearchParams can be directly used in a for...of structure, for example the following two lines are equivelent.
    -The Location interface represents the location (URL) of the object it is linked to. Changes done on it are reflected on the object it relates to. Both the Document and Window interface have such a linked Location, accessible via Document.location and Window.location respectively.
    -Is a stringifier that returns a USVString containing the entire URL. If changed, the associated document navigates to the new page. It can be set from a different origin than the associated document.
    -Replaces the current resource with the one at the provided URL (redirects to the provided URL). The difference from the assign() method and setting the href property is that after using replace() the current page will not be saved in session History, meaning the user won't be able to use the back button to navigate to it.
